Cross-compiling is in "alpha" stage - it has been tested by one person on one platform

1. Extract "config.cpu.c" from configure and cross-compile manually.
2. Take its output, combined with equivalent to any other --with commands your platform needs, and put them in cross_targets/YOURPLATFORM.sed
3. Create a new file cross_targets/YOURPLATFORM.sh that exports CROSS_COMPILE=compiler-prefix, e.g.
  export CROSS_COMPILE=arm-xilinx-linux-gnueabi-
will call arm-xilinx-linux-gnueabi-gcc, arm-xilinx-linux-gnueabi-ld, etc.
4. USTL_CROSS_COMPILE=YOURPLATFORM ./configure
5. make && make check
